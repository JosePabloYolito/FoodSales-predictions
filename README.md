# FoodSales-predictions
This project is about applying all my knowledge of Python Fundamentals and Machine Learning into a sales data base (Hope you enjoy my work!) :)

In this Repository you will se how I cleaned the data base to show some visualizations and also the use of Machine Learning to predict sales. 
Inside the Zip File, you will find a Jupyter Notebook with my codes for this proyect, a presentation of my results and a PowerPoint of the presentation (important to highlight that te Powerpoint and the presentation video are in Spanish).

*** SPOILER ALERT ***
For the Machine Learning process, I used 2 models (linaer regression, as benchmark, and decision tree regression). To see which model predicts better, I optimized the decision tree model by limitting its max_depth to 5 (since it was making overfitting). After that, this model was not doing overfitting and it got better metrics than the liner regression model. In conclution, the decision tree regression is the winner!!!
